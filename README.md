# Personal portfolio website

This website is a personal project to showcase some of my achievements and previous projects. The website was designed and created by Steven Fimbres using HTML5 and CSS. All icons on the page were retrieved using Font Awesome. The page is hosted via Github Pages.

I am updating the webpage with new projects as they are completed. Feel free to check out my portfolio at https://sfimbres.github.io/.
